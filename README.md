# Market Basket Analysis (MBA) Project
This repo contains the Market Basket Analysis (MBA) project as part of my Data Science portfolio. The project documents the steps to implement market basket analysis in Python 3 code. Market Basket Analysis (MBA), also known as association-rule mining, is a useful method of discovering customer purchasing patterns by extracting associations or co-occurrences from transactional databases. It is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of items.  

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available from the **Kaggle** website. It contains the Transactions data from a bakery from 30/10/2016 to 09/04/2017. The data belongs to a bakery called "The Bread Basket" that serves coffee, bread, muffin, cookies and so on. It is located in the historic center of Edinburgh.
